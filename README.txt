README file for code associated with the paper "Circadian Rhythms of Early Afterdepolarizations and Ventricular Arrhythmias in a Cardiomyocyte Model"

Diekman CO and Wei N (2021) Biophysical Journal, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.2264

The equations for the single-cell version of the model are in "diekman_wei_model.m".
Run "reproduceFigure2.m" to produce the plot shown in Figure 2.

The 2-D spatial version of the model can be run with the code "reproduceFigure9B.m" which will reproduce the simulations shown in Figure 9B. See lines 76-79 of this script to adjust parameter settings and reproduce Figures 6 or 9A instead.
